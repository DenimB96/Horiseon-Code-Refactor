# Horiseon-Code-Refactor
Module 1 Challenge

## Instructions
We were required to refactor an existing webpage to make it more accessible.

### Result
I changed and structured HTML elements.
I created accessible alt attirbtues for the images.
I made the title element relative and concise to webpage.
I altered the style sheet and grouped up repetitive classes into one class, then removed the excess code not being used.
I made sure the hyperlinks were active and functioning correctly.
